TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.867 ns between int_tx/div_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and int_tx/dig_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.408 ns between int_tx/div_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and int_tx/dig_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.525 ns between int_tx/div_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and int_tx/state_reg_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

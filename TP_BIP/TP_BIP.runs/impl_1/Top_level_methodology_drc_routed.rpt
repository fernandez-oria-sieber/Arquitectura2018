SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance Data_memory/ram_name_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance Program_memory/ram_name_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
